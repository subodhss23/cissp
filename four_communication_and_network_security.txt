1 TCP/IP Networking

=======================================================

a. Introducing TCP/IP

    - The TCP/IP protocol suite is at the heart of networking.

    - Internet Protocols
        - Route information across networks.
        - Provide an addressing scheme
        - Deliver packets from source to destination.
        - Serve as a network layer protocol

     i) Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)
     ii) User Datagram Protocol (UDP)

    - TCP Flag
        - SYN: opens a connection
        - FIN: closes a connection
        - ACK: acknowledges a SYN or FIN

    - TCP handshake
        --- SYN -->>
        <<--- SYN/ACK ------
        ---- ACK ------->

    - UDP
        - Is a lightweight, connectionless protocol.
        - Doesn't send acknowledgements or guarantee delivery
        - Is used for voice and video applications

    - OSI model
        
        - Application layer         ->> user programs
        - Presentation layer        ->> Data translation and encryption
        - Session layer             ->> Exchanges between systems
        - Transport layer           ->> TCP and UDP
        - Network layer             ->> Internet protocol (IP)
        - Data link layer           ->> Data transfers between two nodes
        - Physical layer            ->> Wires, radios, and optics

    - TCP model                             OSI model
        - application layer             - application, presentation, session layer
        - tranport layer                - transport layer
        - internet layer                - internet layer
        - network interface layer       - data, physical layer

****** EXAM TIPS *********
    - know the seven layers of the OSI model
        and the four layers of the TCP model

b. IP address and DHCP

    - IP address
        - uniquely identify systems
        - dotted quad notation
            - 192.168.0.1
        
        - the range 0-255
        - 8-bit binary numbers
        - 2^8 = 256 possible values
        - range: 0-255 (256 values)

        - Uniquely identify systems on a network
        - must not be reused on internet-connected systems
        - may be reused if on private networks
        
    - Subnets
        - 192.168.1.100
        -network | Host
          address| address
        - can be differnet than this
    
    - IPv6
        - replaces IPv4 due to address exhaustion
        - uses 128 bits
        - consists of eight groups of four hexadecimal numbers
        - example: fd02:24c1:b942:01f3:ead2:123a:c3d2:cf2f

    - Static IPs
        - Static IPs are manually assigned to systems by an administrator. They must be unique
             and within the appropriate range for the network.

    - DHCP
        - The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) allows the automatic assignment of IP
            address from an administrator-configured pool.

    
c. DNS

    - DNS provides address resolution on the internet.

    - DNS Servers
        - translate between domain names and IP addresses

    - DNS functions over UDP port 53.
        
    - DNS resolution
    
    - DNS is a hierarchical system.
        - organizations designate servers that are authoritative for their domains.

    - Some content filters alert DNS query result.

    - DNSSEC
        - Adds digital signatures to DNS
     

d. Network ports

    - Network ports, like apartment numbers, guide traffic to the correct final destination.

    - Network port Numbers
        - 16-bit binary numbers
        - 216 or 65,536 possible values
        - start counting at 0
        - allowable range of 0-65,535

    - Port ranges
        - 0-1, 023: well-known ports
        - 1,024-49,151: registered ports
        - 49,152-65,535: dynamic ports
 
***** EXAM TIPS ******************

e. ICMP

    - The internet control message protocol (ICMP) is the housekeeping protocol of the internet.

    - Ping
        - identifies live systems

    - Traceroute
        - Identifies network paths

    - Other ICMP functions
        - destination unreachable
        - redirects
        - time exceeded
        - addresses mask requests and replies

       
f. Multilayer protocols

    - TCP/IP is the most common multilayer protocol suite.

    - Distributed Network Protocol (DNP3)
        - Provides network connectivity for SCADA systems.
    
    - DNP3 at work

2. Security Network Design

========================================================================

a. Public and private addressing

    - public ip address
        - assigned by a central authority and are routable over the internet
        - manage by ICANN
        - ICANN distributes large blocks of addresses to regional authorities for distribution.

    - private ip address
        - available for anyone's use but not routable over the internet
        
        - 10.0.0.1 - 10.255.255.255
        - 172.16.0.1 - 172.31.255.255
        - 192.168.0.1 - 192.168.255.255

        - private IP addresses are not intenet routable

    - Organizaitons mix public and private addresses

    - Network addresss translation
        - translates between public/private addresses

    - Network Address Translation (NAT)
        
    - NAT and security
        - hides internal addresses from internet systems
        - limits direct access to systems
        - makes it difficult to identify the true origin of traffic
        
    - Port Address Translations (PAT)
        - Allows multiple systems to share the same public address
        - Assigns unique ports to each communication


b. Subnetting

    - subdivides large neworks
    
    - Subnets
        
    - subnet masks
        - identify the dividing line between network and host addresses

    - Binary representation

    - subnet mask notation and slash notation


c. Security zones

    - Firewalls segment networks into seucrity zones to protect systems of differing security levels.

    - Network border firewall
    
    - zero trust
        - system gains no trust based solely upon network location.
    
    - Extranet
        - Intranet segments extended to business partners
    
    - Honeynet
        - Decoy networks designed to attract attackers

    - Ad Hoc Network
        - Temporary networks that may bypass security controls
    
    - East-West Traffic  ******** IMP FOR EXAM ***********
        - Network traffic between systems located in the data center

    - North-South Traffic ******* IMP FOR EXAM ***********
        - Network traffic between systems in the data center and systems on the internet


d. VLANs and network segmentation

    - VLANs
        - Virtual LANs (VLANs) separate systems on a network into logical groups based upon 
            function, regardless of physical location.
        - VLANs extend the broadcast domain.
        
    - configuring VLANS
        - Enable VLAN trunking
        - Assign switchports to VLANs


e. Security device placement

    - security devices must be properly placed within a network.
    
    - Network traffic collectors
        - Intrusion detection and prevention sensors
        - network taps
        - port mirrors
        
     - Security information and event management
        - gather information using collectors
        - analyze information with a centralized aggerations and correlation engine
        - place collectors near the systems generating records
        - place the correlation engine in a secure location
    
    - Proxy servers and content filters typically belong in the DMZ.

    - VPN concentrators
        - Aggregate remote user connections
        - often reside in their own VLAN, where access controls may restrict remote user
            activity.
        - Sophisticated designs may use multiple VLANs for different user roles
     
    - SSL Accelerators
        - handle the difficult cryptographic work of setting up TLS connection

    - Load Balancers
        - distribute connection requests among multiple servers

    - SSL accelerators and load balancers belong in the DMZ.

    - DDoS Mitigation Tools
        - Belong as close to the internet as possible

    - Purchasing DDoSmitigation services from your ISP is an ideal approach.

        

f. Software-defined network (SDN)

    - Software-deifined networking treats network functionality and implementation detail
        separately.

    - Reconfiguring traditional networks requires reconfiguring devices.

    - Control Plane
        - Responsible for making routing and switcing descisions
    
    - Data Plane
        - Responsible for carrying out the instruction of the control plane

    - Software-defined networking (SDN) separates the control plane from the data plane.

    - SDN makes the network programmable.
    
    - Encapulation allows one protocol to carry traffic that uses another protocol.

    - VXLAN builds overlay networks that operate at Layer 2 using Layer 3 equipment.

    - Software-defined wide area networks (SD-WAN) connect larger areas.

    - SDN Security Benefits
        - Allow granular network configuration
        - Facilitate faster response to security incidents
    
    - SDN increases network complexity.


g. Transmission media

    - Layered approaches to networking allow us to abstract the physical layer.

    - Tranmission media allows digital information to be sent over a distance.

    - Ethernet cables transmit electricity over copper wires.

    - Fiber-optic cables transmit light over strands of glass.

    - Wi-Fi communications use radio waves instead of physical media.

    - protect against eavesdropping through the use of encryption.



====================================================================================

3. Network security devices

======================================================================================

a. Routers, switches, and bridges

    - Switches 
        - connect devices to the network.
        - reside in wiring closets and connect the computer in a building together.
        - ethernet jacks are at the other end of network cables connected to switches.
        - Wireless access points (WAPs) connect to switches and create Wi-Fi networks
        - Switches typically work at layer 2 (MAC address only)
        - some switches may function at layer 2 (network layer)
    
    - routers
        - router connect networks to each other, making intelligent packet routing decisions.

    - bridges connect networks using simple forwarding.


b. Firewalls

    - Firewall serve as the security guards at the perimeter of a network.
    - Firewall often connects three networks
        - internal network
        - intenet
        - DMZ

    - Demilitarized Zone (DMZ)
        - Contains systems that must accept direct external connections
        - Isolates those systems due to risk to compromise
        - Protects internal network from compromised DMZ systems

    - Stateless Firewalls
        - Evaluate each connection independently
    
    - Stateful inspection
        - tracks open connections

    - Firewall rule contents
        - Source system address
        - Destination system address
        - Destination port and protocol
        - Action (allow or deny)

    - Impllict Deny
        - If the firewall receives traffic not explicitly allowed by a firewall rule, 
            then that traffic must be blocked.

******* EXAM TIPS ********
    - You need to understand default/implicit deny principle of firewalls.
********************************

    - Next-generation firewalls (NGFWs) incorporate contextual information into their
        decision-making.

    - Other Firewall roles
        - NAT gateway
        - Content/URL filtering
        - Web application firewall
