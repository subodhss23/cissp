1. Identification

=======================================================================================

a. Identification, authenticaion, and authorization

    - Identification
        - only assertion without proof
        - only claim, can be false claim
        - eg username

    - authentication
        - proves identity
        - eg password

    - authorization
        - needs to check that identified person is allowed or has permission
        - combination of username and password has permission

    - Accounting

    - Identity and access management systems should work across cloud and on-permises env.

    

b. Usernames and access cards

    - unique identifier 
    
    - some access card used for identification and authentication
    
    - Magnetic stripe cards
    - Smart cards


c. Biometrics

    Remember that a RADIUS client is usually an application server.
*******************************

    - RADIUS uses UDP.
    
    - TACACS
        - Terminal Access Control Access Control System

    - TACACS+ is current one.

    
g. Kerberos and LDAP

    -  Kerberos is one of the core protocols for Microsoft Active Directory.

    - Ticket-based authentication system that allows users to authenticate to a centralized 
        service and then use tickets to gain access to distributed services.

    - LDAP
        The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) provides the means to query a 
        centralized directory service, such as Microsoft Active Directory.

    - TCP ports
        - Kerberos uses port 88
        - LDAP uses port 389
        - Secure LDAP uses port 636

    - NTLM Authentication

        - identity
        - provider
        

i. Identity as a service (IDaaS)

    - IDaaS providers allow organizations to move IAM to the cloud.

    - IDaaS began by providing SSO for web-based services.

    - Directory Integration
        - Synchronize with an organization's existing on-premises or cloud-based directory
            to obtain user information.

    - Application Integration
        - Replace the authentication services for many SaaS products, simplifying the user and 
            administrative experience.

    - IDaas allows the use of multifactor authentication.

    - Considering IDaaS
        - Verify the product satisfies the organization's business requirements for identity 
            and access maangement
        - Conduct a thorough security review of the product under consideration.

    
j. OAuth and OpenID Connect

    - oauth and openid connetc users
        - linkedin, google, facebook, github

    - OAuth is an authorization protocol.

    - OpenID Connect is an authentication protocol.

    
k. Certificate-based authentication

    - Certificates contain a signed copy of a public key.

    - Key-based authentication
        - eg:- ssh 


==========================================================================================

3. Accountability

===========================================================================================

a. Accountability

    - The ability to trace every action taken on a system back to an individual user without
        nay ambiguity and without allowing the user to deny responsibility for that action.

    - Identification
    
    - Authentication
    
    - Systems must also track user activity through auditing mechanisms.

    - Logs must be secure
        - Use a centralized log server.
    
***** EXAM TIPS ************
    - covered in depth in domain 7 : Security opertions.
****************************
 

b. Session management

    - Uses time out and screen savers to disconnect user serssions that have gone idle, 
        preventing an authorized individual from taking control of an abandoned user session.

    - Timeouts
        - disconnect user sessions after a predetermined time
        - disconnect user sessions after a period of inactivity
        - require re-authentication for sensative activites.

    - Screensavers are a common timeout mechanism.



=============================================================================================

4. Account Management

============================================================================================


a. Understand account and privilege management

    - Account Management Tasks
        - implement least privilege
        - implement separation of duties
        - implement job rotation
        - manage the account life cycle

    - Least privilege
        - Users should have only the minimum set of permission necessary for their job functions

    - Separation of duties
        - Sensitive functions should require action by two separate users.

    - Job rotations
        - regularly move people between jobs to prevent fraud

    - Mandatory vaction 
        - Enforce periods of time when employees have no access to systems(for audit).

    - Standart naming conventions facilitate user identification.

    

b. Account types

    - Differnt account types require different access controls.

    - users account
        - has standard permission and standard monitoring.

    - privileged account
        - has administrative rights and require strong controls

    - privileged accounts should not be used for routine activites.

    - Guest account
    - shared account

    - Service account
        - provides access for internal server processes

***** EXAM TIPS **********
    -Avoid the use of shared/generic accounts and credentials.
**************************


c. Account Policies

    - Group Policy Object (GPO)
        - Applies configuration settings to users and computers.
    

d. Password policies

    - password length and special characters.

**** EXAM TIPS *********
    - Current NIST guidance says that complex passwords should be allowed, but not required.
**************************

    - password expiration policy.

*** EXAM TIPS *****
    - Current NIST guidance says that password should not expire.
****************************

    - Lockout Policies
        - lockout accounts after many incorrect login attempts.
    
    - Disablement
        - Disable unused accounts

    - Benefits of Roles
        - roles simplify account management
        - administrator may assign permission to new users by adding a role to the user.
        - administrator may then remove permission for departing users by removing the role.

    - Roles replace the need for shared accounts.
 

f. Account monitoring

    - Account monitoring protects against security incidents.

    - Inaccurate permissions.
        - can block work and/or violate least privilege.

    - User account audits
        - pull listing of account permissions
        - review with managers
        - make necessary adjustments
        - prioritize review of users with job changes

    - Attestation
        - Formal approval of user privileges

    - auauthorized use
        - continious account monitoring

    - access policy volations

    -  geotagging
        - geofancing
    
    
g. Privileged access management
