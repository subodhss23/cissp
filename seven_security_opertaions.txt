1. Investigations and Forensics
===================================================================

a. Conducting investigation

    - Operational or administrative investigation   
    - Criminal investigation
    - civil investigation
    - regulatory investigation

**** EXAM TIPS *****
    - Cybersecurity investigators should leave interrogations to law enforcement!
********************


b. Evidence types

    - Real evidence
        - consists of tangiable objects    
    
    - Documentary evidence
        - Consists of written information

    - Testimonial evidence
        - consists of witness statements

        - Direct Evidence
        - Expert Opinion


c. introduction to forensics

    - digital forensics
    
    - investigations must never alter evidence.

    - Volatility
        - the relative permanence of a piece of evidence; evidence that may not last long
            is more volatile than more permanent souces of evidence.
    
    - Order of volatility
        - network traffic
        - memory contents
        - system and process data
        - files
        - logs
        - archived records
    

d. System and file forensics

    - Never alter or use original evidence, make a copy of it.

    - Hashes protect evidence
        - they provide a unique file signature.

    - file metadata contains a wealth of forensic information.

***** EXAM TIPS ******
    - Never try to perform forensics yourself unless you're received appropriate training.

e. Network forensics

    - Network communications may be intercepted.

    - wireshark
    - netflow data
     

f. Software forensics

    - intellectual property
    - malware origins

    - email header metadata may be useful for forensic analysis.

    - metadata is very important

g. Mobile device forensics

    - mobile devices are typically protected by strong encryption

h. Embedded devices forensics

    - modern car has collecion of embedded devices.

i. Chain of custody

    - evudence for later analysis
    - evidence log entry

j. Reporting and documenting incidents

    - notify key stakeholders promptly
    - formal incident report
        - create historical documentation


k. Electronic discovery (ediscoery)

    - 



================================================================================
2. Logging and monitoring
============================================================================

a. Security information and event management

    - AI can help to analyse.
    
    - two function
        - central, secure collection point for logs
            - all systems send log entries directly to the SIEM
        - source of artificial interlligence
            - SIEMs detecht patterns that other systems might miss

    - Intrusion detecion system
        - triggers the initial alert
    
    - SIEM dashboard

    - SOAR platform
        - playbooks 
        
   
b.  Continous security monitoring

    - monitoring process
        - define
        - establish
        - implement
        - analyze/report
        - respond
        - review/update

    - anomaly analysis

c. Endpoint monitoring

    - monitor processor, memory, and file system activity.


===================================================================================
3. Resources Security
==================================================================================

a. Physical asset management

    - keeping track of laptop or hardware supplied to employee 
    - keep track of change management
   

b. Change and configuration management

    - changemanagement
    - baseline
    

===================================================================================
4. Security principles
===================================================================================

a. Need to know and least privilege

    - need to know
        - limits information access
        - least privilege
            - limits system permissions
        - privilege aggregation/ privilege creep
            - jeopardizes least privilege
        - 

b. Separation of duties and responsibilities

    - no individual should posses two permissions that, in combination, allow them to
        perform a highly sensitive action.

    - two-person control
        - requires the authorization of two separate individuals to carry out a 
            sensitive action; also known as dual control


c. Privileged account management

    - password vaulting
        - stores admin passwords

    - command proxying
        - eliminates the need of direct server access

    


===================================================================================
5. Incident management
==================================================================================

a. Building an incident response program

   - NIST 800-61
    
    - Incident response plan
        - provides structure during cybersecurity incidents
            - statment of purpose
            - strategies and goals for incident response
            - approach to incident response
            - communication with other groups
    

b. Creating an incident response team

    - must be available 24/7.
   
     - building an IR Team
        - management
        - information security
        - subject matter experts
        - lega counsel
        - public affairs
        - human resources
        - physical security

    - workout the contractual details in advance of a cybersecurity incident.
 

c. Incident identification

    - communication plans ensure that all participants have timely, accurate information.

d. Escalation and notification

    - incident data source
        - IDS/IPS
        - firewalls
        - authentication systems
        - integrity monitors
        - vulnerability scanners
        - system event logs
        - netflow records
        - antimalware packages

    - SIEM
        - central log repository

    - the first resports of an incident may come from external sources.

    - first responders must act quickly
        - isolate affected systems.

    - triaging incidents


e. Mitigation

    - control damange and loss to the organization throgh containment.

    - containment strategy evaluation
        - damange potential
        - evidence preservation
        - service availability
        - resource requirements
        - expected effeciveness
        - solution time frame

    - attacker may detect containment actions.


f. containment techniques

    - the first hours of an incident response are stressful.

    - NIST incident response process

    - containment
        - limit the damange
        
        - segmentation
        - isolation
        - removal


g. incident eradication and recovery

    - Eradication
        - removes all traces of an incident

    - Recovery
        - restores normal operations

    - Eradication and recovery acitivities are colosely linked.

    - Attackers compromise systems
        - rebuild any affected systems to avoid future issues.

    - endpoint security practices
        - application whitelisting
        - application blacklisting
        - quarantine
      
    - sanitization and secure disposal prevents confidential information leakage.
        - clearing - overwriting
        - purging  - more advance 
        - destroying - physically destroying

  h. validation

    - NIST incident response process

    - validation process
        - verify the secure configuration of every system
        - run vulnerability scans
        - perform account and permission reviews
        - verify that systems are logging and communicating security information to the SIEM
       
    - validate that you have successfully restored all capabilities and services.
    

i. post-incident activities

    - lesson learned 
        -provide incident responders with an opportunity to reflect on the incident
        response efforts and offer ffeback that will improve the organization's
        response to future incidents.

    - time is of the essence.

    - NIST guidelines

    - create a report that includes lessons learned and recommendations.

    - follow your change management process.

    - Incident summary report
        - Describes response efforts

    - Retain anay evidence necessary to comply with company policy and legal requirements.


j. incident response exercise

    - Read-through(checklist) ask each team member to review their role in the plan.

    - Walk-throughs or tabletop exercises, gather the team together.
