1. Data Security

======================================================
    
    a. understanding data security
        - Data at rest
        - Data in motion
        - Data in use
        
        - Big data problem

    b. Data Security policy
        - Data Security Policy Criteria
            - Foundational authority for data security efforts
            - Clear expectations for data security responsibilities
            - Guidance for requesting access to information
            - Process for granting policy exceptions

         - Data Classification
            - Describes security levels
            
        - Classification programs establish the basis for other information and asset handling requirements.
        
          - Data storage policies
            - Appropriate storage locations
            - Access control requirements
            - Encryption requirement
    
        - Data transmission policies
            - Appropriate data transmissions
            - Encryption requirements
            - Acceptable transmission mechanisms
           
        - Data lifecycle policy
            - describes end-of-life data
            
            - Data retention policy
            - Data disposal policy
              

    c. Data security roles
        - Data owners
            - are business leaders with overall responsibility for data. They set
                policies and guidelines for their data sets.

**** EXAM TIP ****
    - GDPR uses the term data controller instead of data owner.
********************
        

        - Data Steward
            - handle the day-to-day data governance activities. They are delegated 
                responsibility by data owners.    
        
        - Data Custodian
            - actually store and process information and are often IT
                staff memebers.

        - Data users
            - work with information in their jobs on a daily basis.

        - Data subjects
            - are the individuals referred to the collected data

***** EXAM TIP ********
    - System ownership and data ownership are two different concepts.
***********************


    d. Limiting data collection
        - provide notice and obtain consent for data collection.
        - obtain new consent prior to collecting new information.
        - Minimize information collection
            - delete unnneded information quickly
        - Monitor third parties
            - verify their privacy practices
        

    e. Data life cycle
        - explains the different stages of data in the cloud
            - create
            - store
            - use
            - hare
            - archive
            - Destroy
        
        - Data sanitization techniques
            - clearing overwrites sensative information to frustrate casual analysis
            - purging
            - destroying

2. Data Security Controls

================================================================================

    a. Developing security baselines
    b. Leveraginng industry standards
    c. Customizing security standards
    d. Data encryption
    e. Cloud storage security
    f. Information classification
    g. Digitial rights management
    h. Data loss prevention
    i. cloud access security brokers 



==========================================================================


d. Data encryption

- full disk encryption
- hardware security modules (HSM) 
    - Trusted Platform Modules(TPMs) bring hardware encryption to typical computers.
- Self-Encrypting Drive(SED)
    - performs encryption automatically


e. Cloud storage security

    - cloud storage security controls
        - encryption
        - access control

    - Encryption keys must be protected!

    - Access control

f. Information classification

    - Data Classification Policy 
        - Assigns information into categories, known as classifications,
        which determine storage, handling, and access requirements.

    - Assign classifications based upon
        - sensitivity of information
        - criticality of information
        
    - classification levels
        - military classification
            - Top secret
            - Secret
            - Confidential
            - Unclassified
            
    - Business classification
        - Highly sensitive
        - Sensitive
        - Internal
        - public

    - Classification guides other security decisions.

    - Assets may also be assigned a classification label.

    - Assume that information on a system is classified at the highest
        level authorized for use on that system.

    - Labeling Requirement
        - Identifies sensative information

    - Securely dispose of information when no longer needed.


g. Digital rights management
    
    - Business need to protect their intellectual property.
    
    - Information Rights Managemenet(IRM)
        - Enforcing data rights
        - Provisioning access
        - Implementing access control models
       
    - Digital rights Management (DRM) 
        - Provides the owner of intellectual property with the technical means to prevent the
            unauthorized use of their content through the use of encryption technology.

        - FairPlay was an early example of DRM in the music industry.
    
        - Business Application of DRM
            - Protect trade secrets and other intellectual property
            - Limit redistribution of information
            - Revoke access after expiration date
      
  
h. Data loss prevention
    
        - Organizations routinely handles sensitive information.
        
        - Data Loss Prevention (DLP)
            - Technology solutions that search systems and monitor networks for sensative
                information that is unsecured and provide the ability to remove the information,
                block the tranmission, or encrypt the stored data.

        - Host-Based DLP
            - Uses software agents intalled on a single system

        -
