    c. Data security roles
        - Data owners
            - are business leaders with overall responsibility for data. They set
                policies and guidelines for their data sets.

**** EXAM TIP ****
    - GDPR uses the term data controller instead of data owner.
********************
        

        - Data Steward
            - handle the day-to-day data governance activities. They are delegated 
                responsibility by data owners.    
        
        - Data Custodian
            - actually store and process information and are often IT
                staff memebers.

        - Data users
            - work with information in their jobs on a daily basis.

        - Data subjects
            - are the individuals referred to the collected data

***** EXAM TIP ********
    - System ownership and data ownership are two different concepts.
***********************


    d. Limiting data collection
        - provide notice and obtain consent for data collection.
        - obtain new consent prior to collecting new information.
        - Minimize information collection
            - delete unnneded information quickly
        - Monitor third parties
            - verify their privacy practices
        

    e. Data life cycle
        - explains the different stages of data in the cloud
            - create
            - store
            - use
            - hare
            - archive
            - Destroy
        
        - Data sanitization techniques
            - clearing overwrites sensative information to frustrate casual analysis
            - purging
            - destroying

2. Data Security Controls

================================================================================

    a. Developing security baselines
    b. Leveraginng industry standards
    c. Customizing security standards
    d. Data encryption
    e. Cloud storage security
    f. Information classification
    g. Digitial rights management
    h. Data loss prevention
    i. cloud access security brokers 



==========================================================================


d. Data encryption

- full disk encryption
- hardware security modules (HSM) 
    - Trusted Platform Modules(TPMs) bring hardware encryption to typical computers.
- Self-Encrypting Drive(SED)
    - performs encryption automatically


e. Cloud storage security

    - cloud storage security controls
        - encryption
        - access control

    - Encryption keys must be protected!

    - Access control

f. Information classification

    - Data Classification Policy 
        - Assigns information into categories, known as classifications,
        which determine storage, handling, and access requirements.

    - Assign classifications based upon
        - sensitivity of information
        - criticality of information
        
    - classification levels
        - military classification
            - Top secret
            - Secret
            - Confidential
            - Unclassified
            
    - Business classification
        - Highly sensitive
        - Sensitive
        - Internal
        - public

    - Classification guides other security decisions.

    - Assets may also be assigned a classification label.

    - Assume that information on a system is classified at the highest
        level authorized for use on that system.

    - Labeling Requirement
        - Identifies sensative information

    - Securely dispose of information when no longer needed.


g. Digital rights management
    
    - Business need to protect their intellectual property.
    
    - Information Rights Managemenet(IRM)
        - Enforcing data rights
        - Provisioning access
        - Implementing access control models
       
    - Digital rights Management (DRM) 
        - Provides the owner of intellectual property with the technical means to prevent the
            unauthorized use of their content through the use of encryption technology.

        - FairPlay was an early example of DRM in the music industry.
    
        - Business Application of DRM
            - Protect trade secrets and other intellectual property
            - Limit redistribution of information
            - Revoke access after expiration date
      
  
h. Data loss prevention
    
        - Organizations routinely handles sensitive information.
        
        - Data Loss Prevention (DLP)
            - Technology solutions that search systems and monitor networks for sensative
                information that is unsecured and provide the ability to remove the information,
                block the tranmission, or encrypt the stored data.

        - Host-Based DLP
            - Uses software agents intalled on a single system

        - Network-Based DLP
            - Scans network transmissions for sensative information

        - Pattern matching
            - Recognizes known patterns of sensative information, such as socal security numbers

        - Watermarking
            - Identifies sensative information using electronic tags

        - Cloud-based DLP systems operate as managed security services.


i. Cloud access security brokers
        
        - Managed service providers (MSPs) offer information technology services to customers.

        - Managed Security Providers (MSSPs) provide security services for other organizations
            as a managed service.

        - MSSps must be carefully monitored.

        - MSSP service examples:-
            - Manage an entire security infrastructure
            - Monitor system logs
            - Manage firewalls or networks
            - Perform identity and access management

******** EXAM TIPS ***********
    - MSSPs may also be referred to as security as a service (SECaaS).
**************************************

        - Cloud Access Security Brokers (CASBs) add a third-party security layer to the
            interactions that users have with other cloud services.

        - Network-Based CASB
            - Broker intercepts traffic between the user and the cloud service, monitoring for
                security issues.
            - Broker can block requests.

        - API-Based CASB
            - The broker queries the cloud service via API.
            - Broker may not be able to block requests, depending upon API capabilities.

        - MSSP relationships should be carefully documented.

3. Change and Configuration Management

===============================================================================================

    a. Change management

        - Change comes frequently in the world of information technology.

        - Change is good
            - But it must be controlled!
        
        - Change management
            - Ensures that an organization follows a standard process for requesting, reviewing,
                approving, and implementing changes to information systems.

        - Request For Change (RFC)
            - Description of the change
            - Expected impact
            - Risk assessment
            - Rollback plan
            - Identity of those involved
            - Proposed schedule
            - Affected configuration items
        
        - Changes must be approved by relevant authorities.

        - Routine changes may be preapproved.


    b. Configuration and asset management

        - Tracks specific device settings.

        - Baselines
            - Provide a configuration snapshot.
        
        - Versioning
            - Assigns numbers to each version.

        - Diagrams serve as important configuration artifacts.

        - Standardize Device Configurations
            - Naming conventions
            - IP addressing schemes
        
        - Change and configuration management help ensure a stable operating environment.

    
    c. Physical asset management
        
        - Maintaining control of physical assets begins with an asset inventory.

        - Asset management should follow a lifecycle approach.

        - Data updates are critical.

        - Media management
            - Tracks highly sensitive data


    d. Supply chan vulnerabilities
        
        - Security issues may arise in the supply chain.
        
        - Running products that lack vendor support introduces significant security risks.

        - End-of-sale
            - product will no longer be offered for purchase, but the vendor will support existing
                customers.
     
        - End-of-support
            - The vendor will reduce or eliminate support for existing users of the product

        - End-of-life
            - The vendor will no longer provide any suppport or updates for the product

        - Vendors may fail to provide adequate supprt for existing products.

        - Vendors may not disclose the use of embedded systems.

        - Mitigate risks associated with data storage and other vendor dependencies.
