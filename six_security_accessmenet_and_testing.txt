1. Vulnerability Scanning

==============================================================================================

a. What is vulnerability management?

    - Vulnerability paching process.
    
    - Vulnerability management
        - detects, remediates, and reports vulnerabilities.

     - PCI DSS requirements
        - conduct quarterly internaly and external vulnerability scans
        - repeat scan after any signinficant change
        - use an approved scanning vendor (ASV)

    - FISMA requirements
        - conduct vulnerability scan regularly
        - analyze the result of scans
        - remedicate legitimate vulnerabilities
        - share information with other agancies

b. Identify scan targets

    - Asset inventory
       - provides the starting point for vulnerability scanning

    - vulnerability scanner can generate system inventories.

    - Nessus

    - Three key areas:-
        i) Impact
        ii) Likelihood
        iii) Criticality

    - You need an asset inventory even if you choose to scan all of your systems.


c. Scan configuration

    - setting up nessus
    

d. Scan prespective

    - Firewall settings, IDS/IPS rules, and network segmentation all impact scan results.

    - Agent-based scanning
        - installs software on each target device

    - Credentialed scanning
        - Uses password to log into systems


e. Analyzing scan reports

    - Cybersecurity analysts need to present diffenet information to different audiences.

    - Prioritization Facotrs
        - Vulnerability severity
        - System criticality
        - Information sensitivity
        - Remediation difficulty

    - Vulnerability Validation
        - Confirms accuracy

    - False positive


f. Correlating scan results

    - Correlate scan result with other souce of information.
    - Consult industry standards, best practices, and compliance requirements.

    - PCI DSS CVSS Scores

    - Technical information sources
    
    - Trend analysis


===============================================================================================

2. Penetration Testing

==============================================================================================

a. Penetration testing

    - executing attacks

    - document the rulles of engagement before beginning a penetration test.

    - whitbox test
    - gray box test
    - blackbox test

    - penetration testing process
        - discover process
        - attack phase
            - gaining access
            - escalating privileges
            - system browsing
            - install additional tool

    - Pivot
        - After exploiting a vulnerability in a system, attacker use the system as a base
             from which to target other systems on the same local network.

    - Presistence
        - After exploiting a vulnerability in a system, attackers install tools on that system
            to allow future access-even if the intial vulnerability is corrected.

    - Breach and attack simulation (BAS)
        - platforms that automate penetration testing by injecting threat indicators onto
            systems and networks


b. Ethical discolsure

    - zero-day vulnerability
    - the window of vulnerability begin

    - vulnerability disclosure options
        - share privately with the vendor
        - share publicly with the security community
        - keep knowledge secret for persnal use or sale

    - Responsible disclosure


c. Bug bounty

    - bug bounty programs

d. Cybersecurity exercises

    - identify vulnerabilities in systems
    - provide participants with hands-on experience attacking and securing systems.

    - Red team
    - blue team
    - white team

    - purple team

    - capture the flag
    
    - use sandbax

==============================================================================================

3. Log Reviews

============================================================================================

a. Logging security information

    - log and data structure
        - network or netflow
        - DNS
        - system ( event logs)
        - application
        - authentication
        - VoIP
        - Dump files
        - vulnerabilities scan

    -Syslog
        - provides a logging standard

    - syslog message components
        - header (timestamp, source address)
        - facility (source of message on the sending system)
        - severity (importance value from 0 to 7)
        - message (details of the situation)

    - syslog severity levels from 0 to 7 (0 being most critical)

    - Linux supports syslog natively.

    - syslog versions
        - syslog
        - syslog-ng
        - rsyslog
        - journalctl

    - Tags facilitate searching, filtering, and analysis.

    - NXLog centralizes the management of disparate logs.

    
b. Security information and event management

    - systems generate far too many log records for manual analysis.

    - SIEM has two functions:-
        - central, secure collection point for logs
            - all systems send log entries directly to the SIEM
        - source of artificial intelligence
            - SIEMs detect patters that other systems might miss

    - Intrusion detection system
        - traiggers the intial alert

    - firewall logs
        - suspicious connection
    = web server log
        - sql injection attack
    - db log
        - large query
    - router log   
        - large outbound data flow

    - SIEM dashboards
        - provide a centralized view of security information
        - generate alerts for unusal activity
        - facilitate trend analysis
        - offer adjustable sensitivity


    - SOAR
        - Security Orchestration Automation Response
        - playbooks
            - process-focused response to security events, including both human and automated 
                actions
        - runbooks
            - automated response to security events that execute immediately and aid human 
                investigators


==============================================================================================

4. Code testing

=============================================================================================

a. Code review

    - use peer analysis to assess code.

    - Fagan inspections follow a formalized, six-step code review process.
        - planning
        - overview
        - preparation
        - metting
        - rework
        - follow up


b. Code tests

    - use technology to inspect software.

    - static test
    - dynamic test

****** EXAM TIPS *******
    - Code reviews, static testing, and dynamic testing are complementary, rather than competitiors.

************************

c. Fuzz testing

    - fuzzing is a software testing technique taht feeds software many different input values
        in an attempt to cause an unpredictable state or unauthorized access.

    - fuzzing testing input sources
        - delveoper-supplied input
        - developer-supplied script
        - generation fuzzing
        - mutation fuzzing


d. Interface testing

    - API defines interactions between systems
    

e. Misuse case testing

    - Misuse case testing evaluates software from the attacker's prespective.


f. Test coverage analysis

    - test coverage
        - percent of software tested

    - computing test coverage
        - test coverage = cases tested / total cases

    - test coverage variables
        - use cases
        - functions
        - lines of code
        - conditional branching

    - automated testing packages can compute test coverage.


===============================================================================================

5. Business continuity planning

==============================================================================================

a. Business continuity planning

    - The set of controls designed to keep a business running in the face of adversity,
        whether natural or man-made.

**** EXAM TIPS **********
    - Business continuity planning is also known as contunity of operations planning (COOP).
*************************

    - Availability

    - Defining the BCP Scope.
        - What business acitivities will the plan cover?
        - What systems will it cover?
        - What controls will it consider?

    - Business Impact Assessment (BIA)
        - Identifies and prioritizes risks

****** EXAM TIPS ************
    - Business continuity planning in the cloud is a partnership between providers and customers.
*******************************

b. Business continuity controls

    - Single point of failure analysis
        - identifies and removed SPOFs

    - SPOF analysis continues until the cost of addressing risks outweigs the benefit.


c. High availability and fault tolerance

    - High availability
        - uses multiple systems to protect against service failure.

    - fault tolerance
        - makes a single system resilient against technical failure.

    - Load balancing
        - spreads demand across sytems

    - three point of failures are:-
        - power supply
        - storage
        - network

***** EXAM TIPS ************
    - RAID is a fault-tolerance technique, not a backup strategy.
****************************


===============================================================================================

6. Disaster recovery planning

==============================================================================================

a. Disaster recovery

    - Disaster recovery capabilities are designed to restore a business to normal operations
        as quickly as possible. Disaster recovery is a subset of business continuity.

    - can be caused by environmental or man-made disaster.

    - can come from internal or external source.

    - moves to assessment mode from initial mode.

    - disaster recovery metrics
        - The recovery time objective (RTO) is the maximum amount of time that it should take to
            recover a service after a disaster.


b. Backups

    - most important for an organization
    - provide a data safetly net.

    - backup media
        - tape backup
        - disk-to-disk backups
        - cloud backups
     
    - full backups
        - include a complete copy of all data

    - differential backups          *************
        - include all data modified since the last full backup

    - incremental backups           **********************
        - include all data modified since the last full or incremental backup

    
c. Restoring backups

    - non-persistence 
    - configuration problems may be corrected by reverting to a known state.
    - live boot media may allow recovery of data from a device witha corrupted os.


d. Disaster recover sites

    - hot site
        - fully operational data centers
        - stocked with equipment and data
        - available at a moment's nontice
        - very expensive    
    
    - cold sites
        - empty data centers
        - stocked with core equipment, network, and environmental controls
        - relatively inexpensive
        - operational in weeks or months

    - warm sites
        - stocked with all necessary equipment and data
        - not maintained in a parallel fashion
        - similar in expense to hot sites
        - available in hours or days

    - offsite storage
        - geographically distant
        - site resiliency
        - manual transfer or site replication through SAN or VM

        
e. Testing BC/DR plans

    - Disaster recovery testing goals
        - validate that the plan functions correctly
        - identifies necessary plan updates

    - disaster recovery test types
        - read-through
            - read-through ask each team member to rewview their role in the disaster recovery process
                provide feedback.

        - walk-through
            - walk-throughs gather the team together for a formal review of the disaster recovery plan.

        - simulation
            - simulation use a practice scenario to test the disaster recovery plan.

        - parallel test
            - parallel tests activate the disaster recovery environment but do not switch operations
                there.
    
        - full interuption test
            - Full-interuption test switch primary operations to the alternate environment and can be
                very disruptive to business.

    - often combination of muliple types of tests.
 

f. After action reports

    - After action reports crate a formal record of a disaster recovery (DR) or business continity
        (BC) event.

    - AAR (After Action Reports)

    - Conduct after action reviews after every BC or DR event, even those that are considered
        successful.

    - Begin with report with a brief executive summary.

    - provide enough background to allow the reader to understand the context.

    - answer all the key factual questions around the event.
        - what? where? when? why?

    - should include lesson leaered during the response.

    - conclude with clear next steps.
 
===============================================================================================

7. Assessing security processes

==============================================================================================

a. Collect security process data

    - Management and operational controls supplement technnical controls.

    - SIEMs process and correlate the information.

    - security process data
        - records about management controls

    - use consistent, repeatable processes for gathering security information.


b. Management review and approval

    - management reviews serve as a check-and-balance.

    - two important role:-
        - verify accuracy and completeness
        - create a culture of oversigh.

    - privileged user action reviews


c. Security metrics

    - Key performance indicator (KPIs)
    
    - Key risk indicator (KRIs)


d. Audits and assessments

    - assesments are usually requested internally while audits are often imposed by external 
        requirements.

    - audits follows a formal standard and use planned tests.

    - gap analysis


e. Control management

    - organizations should test security controls regularly.

    - every rule has an exception
        - and exceptions must be carefully managed!
