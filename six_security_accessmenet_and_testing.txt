1. Vulnerability Scanning

==============================================================================================

a. What is vulnerability management?

    - Vulnerability paching process.
    
    - Vulnerability management
        - detects, remediates, and reports vulnerabilities.

     - PCI DSS requirements
        - conduct quarterly internaly and external vulnerability scans
        - repeat scan after any signinficant change
        - use an approved scanning vendor (ASV)

    - FISMA requirements
        - conduct vulnerability scan regularly
        - analyze the result of scans
        - remedicate legitimate vulnerabilities
        - share information with other agancies

b. Identify scan targets

    - Asset inventory
       - provides the starting point for vulnerability scanning

    - vulnerability scanner can generate system inventories.

    - Nessus

    - Three key areas:-
        i) Impact
        ii) Likelihood
        iii) Criticality

    - You need an asset inventory even if you choose to scan all of your systems.


c. Scan configuration

    - setting up nessus
    

d. Scan prespective

    - Firewall settings, IDS/IPS rules, and network segmentation all impact scan results.

    - Agent-based scanning
        - installs software on each target device

    - Credentialed scanning
        - Uses password to log into systems


e. Analyzing scan reports

    - Cybersecurity analysts need to present diffenet information to different audiences.

    - Prioritization Facotrs
        - Vulnerability severity
        - System criticality
        - Information sensitivity
        - Remediation difficulty

    - Vulnerability Validation
        - Confirms accuracy

    - False positive


f. Correlating scan results

    - Correlate scan result with other souce of information.
    - Consult industry standards, best practices, and compliance requirements.

    - PCI DSS CVSS Scores

    - Technical information sources
    
    - Trend analysis

2. Penetration Testing

==============================================================================================

a. Penetration testing

    - executing attacks

    - document the rulles of engagement before beginning a penetration test.

    - whitbox test
    - gray box test
    - blackbox test

    - penetration testing process
        - discover process
        - attack phase
            - gaining access
            - escalating privileges
            - system browsing
            - install additional tool

    - Pivot
        - After exploiting a vulnerability in a system, attacker use the system as a base
             from which to target other systems on the same local network.

    - Presistence
        - After exploiting a vulnerability in a system, attackers install tools on that system
            to allow future access-even if the intial vulnerability is corrected.

    - Breach and attack simulation (BAS)
        - platforms that automate penetration testing by injecting threat indicators onto
            systems and networks


b. Ethical discolsure

    - zero-day vulnerability
    - the window of vulnerability begin

    - vulnerability disclosure options
        - share privately with the vendor
        - share publicly with the security community
        - keep knowledge secret for persnal use or sale

    - Responsible disclosure


c. Bug bounty

    - bug bounty programs

d. Cybersecurity exercises

    - identify vulnerabilities in systems
    - provide participants with hands-on experience attacking and securing systems.

    - Red team
    - blue team
    - white team

    - purple team

    - capture the flag
    
    - use sandbax
