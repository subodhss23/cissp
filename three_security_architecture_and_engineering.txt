1. Secure Design
=================================================================

a. Security design principles

    - Security is a design element
        - bolt-on security rarely works.

    - Subject/Object Model
        - subject ------> object
        - User    ------> File
        - Process ------> Memory
     
    - Clearly designating subjects and objects improves design quality.

    - Failure modes
        - fail open
            - failed security controls are bypassed

        - fail secure
            - failed security controls block access

        - IDS (intruser detection system) failure
            
        - Isolation and segmentation


b. Security models

    - Security models provide a theoretical way of describing security controls.

    - Three levels of security models:-

    i) Multilevel security
        - Systems designed to operate at different security levels simultaneously while
            enforcing confidentiality and integrity constraints that restrict access
            between security levels.

     ii) Bell-LaPadula Model
        - Enforces confidentiality
        - simple security rule
            - No "read up"
        - *-property
            - No "write down" 
        
**** EXAM TIPS **********
    - The Bell-LaPadula model is rarely implemented outside of military applications.
*************************

    iii) Biba Model
        - Enforces integrity
        - Simple integrity property
            - No "read down"
        - *-Integrity property
            - No "write up"

***** EXAM TIPS ************
    - THE Bell-laPadula and Biba models are important for the exam but rarely used in the 
        real world.
*****************************


c. Security evaluation models

    - Cyber security programs first appeared within goverment agencies.
    - Trusted Computer System Evaluation Criteria (TCSEC)
    - Common Criteria
        - Unified evaluation processes
    - Certification and Accreditation
        - Certification
            - Determines that a system meets security criteria
        - Accrediation
            - Approves use of a system in a specific environment
        - Accrediation Decisions
            - Authorization to Operate (ATO)
            - Interim Authorization to Operate (IATO)
            - Interim Authorization to Test (IATT)
            - Denial of Authorization to Operate (DATO)

***** EXAM TIPS **********************
    - Certification and accreditation are different.
    - Accreditation and authorization are the same.
**************************************************** 


d. Seperation of duties

    - No individual should possess two permission that, in combination, allow them to
        perform a highly sensative action.
    
    - Two-person Control
        - requires the authorization of two separate individuals to carry out a sensitive
            actions; also known as dual control.


f. Selecting security controls

    - Security Controls
        - Procedures and mechanisms that an organization puts in place to manage security risks.
        - Defense in Depth
            - Multiple controls for one objective
            
    - We categorize controls by their purpose for mechanism of action.
    
        i) Preventive
            - Stop a security issue from occurring in the first place.
            
        ii) Detective
            - Identify that a potential security issue has taken place.
        
        iii) Corrective
            - Remediate security issue that have already occured.

        iv) Deterrent
            - Prevent an attacker from seeking to violate security policies.

        v) Physical
            - Impact the physical world.

        vi) Compensating
            - Fill a known gap in a security environment.

    - Technical controls
        - Use technology to achieve security control objectives.

    - Operational controls
        - Use human-driven processes to manage technology in a secure manner.

**** EXAM TIPS ******
    - Technical controls are implemented by technology; operational controls are implemented by people.
************************

    - Management controls
        - Imporve the security of the risk maangement process itself


g. Privacy by design
    
    - Privacy by design seeks to incorporate privacy practices into the design and implementation of systems.

    i) Proactive, not reactive; preventive, not remedial.
    ii) Privacy as the default setting
    iii) Privacy embedded into design
    iv) Full functionality: positive sum, not zero sum
    v) End-to-end security full lifecycle protection
    vi) Visibility and transparency: keep it open
    vii) Respect for user privacy: keep it user-centric
        

h. Secure defaults

    - Secure defaults ensure that a system runs in a secure mode if we don't configure it otherwise.

    - The zero-trust model applies least privilege to network access.

    - Zero-trust replaces network-based access control with strong user-focused authentication.

    - Trust, but verify.


========================================================================================

2. Virtualization and Cloud Computing

========================================================================================

a. What is the cloud?
    
    - Cloud computing is transforming information technology across industries.
    
    - Delivering computing resources to remote customer over a network.
    
    - NIST Defination
        - A model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to shared
            pool of configurable computing resource (e.g, network, servers, storage, 
            applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with
            minimal management effort or service provider interation.


b. Cloud computing roles?

    - Two primary roles:-
        i) Cloud service provider
        ii) Cloud customer

        - cloud service partner
            - provides add- on services
    
        - Cloud Access Security Broker (CASB)
            - provides IAM services
    

c. Drivers for cloud computing
        
        - On-Demand Self-Service
            - Available when you need it.

        - Scalability
            - Increasing capacity with demand.

            - Horizontal Scaling
                - Adding more servers to the pool to meet increased demand

            - Vertical scaling
                - Adding more resources (eg, CPU or memory) to existing server to meet increasing demand.

            - Elasticity
                - Expanding and contracting quickly

            - Broad Network Access
                - Anytime, anywhere access

            - Measured Service
                - Paying only for what you consume


d. Multitenant computing

        - Multitenancy
            - Shared computing resources

        - Isolation
            - users don't impact each other.

        - Oversubscription
            - Sold capacity exceeds actual capacity.

        - Resource pooling
            - CPU and memory shared among users.

e. Virtualization
    
    - Host machines run on physical hardware.
    - Host machines provide services to several virtualized guest machines.
    - The hypervisor tricks each guest into thinking it is running on dedicated hardware.
    

    - Two types of hyervisors:-
        i) Type 1 Hypervisor
            - Hypervisor run on top of physical hardware and runs guest virtual machine on top of that.
            - one used in data centers.

        ii) Type 2 Hypervisor
            - Hypervisor runs on top of host OS parallel to other application, and runs guest vms on top.
            - one used in personal computers.


    - Virtualization Security
        - Virtual machine isolation is critical
        - Each server must have access to only its own memory and storage.
        - VM escape attacks attempt to break out of the guest environment.
        
    - Virtualization platform must be patched against security vulnerabilities.

    - VM Sprawl
        - Unused and unmaintained servers.

    
f. Desktop and application virtualization

    - Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI)
            - provides network-bases access to a desktop computing environment.

    - Application Virtualization
            - Streams applications to the user's desktop
    
    - Desktop and application virtualization enable the use of thin client devices.


g. Cloud compute resources

    - Virtualized servers run in cloud data centers.

    - High Availability
        - Uses resources across zones
    
    - Instance Awareness
        - Reduces VM sprawl.
    

h. Containerization

    - Containers
        - Lightweight application virtualization

    - Virtual servers run on top of a hypervisor.

    - Containers are a lightweight alternative to virual servers.

    - Containers
        - Contain application code and dependencies only
        - Run on containerization platforms
        - Use the host's operating system

    - isolation is the most critical container security issue.


i. cloud activities and the Cloud Reference Architecture
    
    - ISO/IEC 17789:2014
        - Information technology - Cloud computing - Reference architecture
        
**** EXAM TIPS ******
     Reference architectures provide a useful framework, but they're just a starting point.

j. Cloud deployment models
    
    - Cloud deployment models describe the cloud environmenet types that organizations might use.

    - Private cloud
        - Organization uses a dedicated cloud infrastructure.

    - public cloud
        - Organization uses a multitenancy infrastructure.

    - Hybrid cloud
        - Organization uses both private and public cloud.

    - public cloud computing uses a shared responsibility model.

    - Community cloud
        - shared with a consortium

**** EXAM TIPS ********
    - No cloud model is inherently superior to the other approaches. It all depends on the context.
************************


k. Cloud service categories

        - PaaS (Platform as a Service)
            - Customer purcheses app platform.

        - IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)   
            - Customer purchases servers/storage.

        - Function as a Service(Faas)
            - Also known as serverless computing.


l. Edge and fog computing
    
    - Edge computing
        - Computing on the endpoint

    - Fog computing
        - computing near the endpoint

============================================================================================

3. Memory

===========================================================================================

a. Memory protection

    - Memory is a shared resources taht must be protected.

    - Two types of memory:-
        -RAM
        -ROM
    
    - Memory management:-
        - Tracks what application are using each segment of memeory
        - Grants request for additional memory
        - Frees up memory that is no longer needed.

    - Memory protection:-
        - Restricts access to memory segments

    - Segmentation Fault
        - Error that occurs when an application requests unauthorized access to a memory segment.

    - Memory leak
        - Application accumulate memory over time and fail to release it when no longer needed.


b. Hardware encryption

    - Encryption protects sensative data by transforming it so that it may not be read by 
        anyone without the appropriate decryption key. 
    
    - AES Crypt
        - Open-source file encryption

    - Full-Disk Encryption (FDE)
        - protects and entire drive

    - Hardware Security Modules (HSM)
        - Manages encryption Keys

    - Trusted Platform Modules (TPMs) 
        - bring hardware encryption to  typical computers.

    - Self-Encrypting Drive (SED)
        - Performs encryption automatically


c.Hardware and firmware security

    - Operating systems must be loaded frrom disk during the boot process.
    
    - Basic Input/Output System (BIOS)
        - Lightweight operating system stored in firmware that provides the basic 
            functionality necessary to load the full operating system from disk.
  
    - Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI)
        - Replaces BIOS with a flexible alternative

    - Secure Boot
        - Read the boot loader from disk.
        - Compute the hash of the boot loader.
        - Decrypt the boot loader's digitial signature.
        - Verify that the signature is accurate.
        - Booting stops abruptly if the boot loader's digital signature fails verification.
      
    - Remote attestation sends a compliance report to an external server.

    - Measured Boot
        - Each device verifies the hash of the next device in the boot chain.
        - Attestation
            - Confirmed hashes are stored in the TPM.

    - Hardware root of trust
        - verifies firmware integrity

    - Together, the hardware root of trust, UEFI, TPM, and secure boot provide trusted execution.

    - Electromagnetic Interference (EMI) 
        - Electrmagnetic waves, normally generated unintentionally, that cause disruption to
            nearby electronic equipment.
