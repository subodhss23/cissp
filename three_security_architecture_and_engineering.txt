1. Secure Design
=================================================================

a. Security design principles

    - Security is a design element
        - bolt-on security rarely works.

    - Subject/Object Model
        - subject ------> object
        - User    ------> File
        - Process ------> Memory
     
    - Clearly designating subjects and objects improves design quality.

    - Failure modes
        - fail open
            - failed security controls are bypassed

        - fail secure
            - failed security controls block access

        - IDS (intruser detection system) failure
            
        - Isolation and segmentation


b. Security models

    - Security models provide a theoretical way of describing security controls.

    - Three levels of security models:-

    i) Multilevel security
        - Systems designed to operate at different security levels simultaneously while
            enforcing confidentiality and integrity constraints that restrict access
            between security levels.

     ii) Bell-LaPadula Model
        - Enforces confidentiality
        - simple security rule
            - No "read up"
        - *-property
            - No "write down" 
        
**** EXAM TIPS **********
    - The Bell-LaPadula model is rarely implemented outside of military applications.
*************************

    iii) Biba Model
        - Enforces integrity
        - Simple integrity property
            - No "read down"
        - *-Integrity property
            - No "write up"

***** EXAM TIPS ************
    - THE Bell-laPadula and Biba models are important for the exam but rarely used in the 
        real world.
*****************************


c. Security evaluation models

    - Cyber security programs first appeared within goverment agencies.
    - Trusted Computer System Evaluation Criteria (TCSEC)
    - Common Criteria
        - Unified evaluation processes
    - Certification and Accreditation
        - Certification
            - Determines that a system meets security criteria
        - Accrediation
            - Approves use of a system in a specific environment
        - Accrediation Decisions
            - Authorization to Operate (ATO)
            - Interim Authorization to Operate (IATO)
            - Interim Authorization to Test (IATT)
            - Denial of Authorization to Operate (DATO)

***** EXAM TIPS **********************
    - Certification and accreditation are different.
    - Accreditation and authorization are the same.
**************************************************** 


d. Seperation of duties

    - No individual should possess two permission that, in combination, allow them to
        perform a highly sensative action.
    
    - Two-person Control
        - requires the authorization of two separate individuals to carry out a sensitive
            actions; also known as dual control.


f. Selecting security controls

    - Security Controls
        - Procedures and mechanisms that an organization puts in place to manage security risks.
        - Defense in Depth
            - Multiple controls for one objective
            
    - We categorize controls by their purpose for mechanism of action.
    
        i) Preventive
            - Stop a security issue from occurring in the first place.
            
        ii) Detective
            - Identify that a potential security issue has taken place.
        
        iii) Corrective
            - Remediate security issue that have already occured.

        iv) Deterrent
            - Prevent an attacker from seeking to violate security policies.

        v) Physical
            - Impact the physical world.

        vi) Compensating

************************

    - Management controls
        - Imporve the security of the risk maangement process itself


g. Privacy by design
    
    - Privacy by design seeks to incorporate privacy practices into the design and implementation of systems.

    i) Proactive, not reactive; preventive, not remedial.
    ii) Privacy as the default setting
    iii) Privacy embedded into design
    iv) Full functionality: positive sum, not zero sum
    v) End-to-end security full lifecycle protection
    vi) Visibility and transparency: keep it open
    vii) Respect for user privacy: keep it user-centric
        

h. Secure defaults

    - Secure defaults ensure that a system runs in a secure mode if we don't configure it otherwise.

    - The zero-trust model applies least privilege to network access.

    - Zero-trust replaces network-based access control with strong user-focused authentication.

    - Trust, but verify.


========================================================================================

2. Virtualization and Cloud Computing

========================================================================================

a. What is the cloud?

            - one used in personal computers.


    - Virtualization Security
        - Virtual machine isolation is critical
        - Each server must have access to only its own memory and storage.
        - VM escape attacks attempt to break out of the guest environment.
        
    - Virtualization platform must be patched against security vulnerabilities.

    - VM Sprawl
        - Unused and unmaintained servers.

d. Codes and ciphers

**** EXAM TIPS ***************
    - Codes and ciphers are related concepts, but you should know the difference when you 
       take the exam.
****************************
   
     - Code
        - A system that substitutes one word or phrase for anther; intended to provide
            secrecy and/or efficiency.
        
     - Cipher
        - Asystem taht use mathematical algorithms to encrypt and decrypt messages.

    - Stream Ciphers
        - Operate on one character, or bit, of a message at a time.

    - Block ciphers
        - Operate on large segments of the message at the same time.

    - Substitution Ciphers
        - Change the characters in a message.

    - Substitution ciphers that shift each letter by an increment are called rotation ciphers. (ROT)

    - Transposition Ciphers
        - Rearrange the characters in a message.

    - Substitution and transposition are the building blocks of modern cryptography.


e. Cryptographic math

    - Math plays a central role in cryptography

    - Exclusive or (XOR)
        - True when exactly one of two input values is true.
   
    - Cryptography relies upon pseudorandom number generation because we lack a  source of 
        truly random numbers.

    - Confusion
        - Every bit of the ciphertext must depend upon more than one bit of the encryption key.
    
    - Diffusion
        - Changing a single bit of the plaintext should change about 50% of the ciphertext bits.

    - Obfuscation
        - Uses cryptography to hide source code from users.


e. Choosing encryption algorithms

*** EXAM TIPS *********
    - Don't try to build your own encryption algorithm unless you really know what you're doing.
***************************

    - Security through Obscurity
        - Security of an algorithm depends upon the secrecy of its approach.
    
    - Choosing your key length

    - Use tested encrytion modules and cryptographic service providers.



f. The perfect encryption algorithm

    - One-Time pad
        - It is an unbreakable encryption algorithm
        - Sender and receiver have identical pads
        - Key is at least as long as the message


g. The cryptographic lifecycle

    - The cryptographic lifecycle manages the use of encryption materials over time.

    - As cryptographic algorithms age, they often become insecure.

    - NSIT 5 phase cryptograhic lifecycle:-
        i) initiation
        ii) development and acquisition
        iii) implementation and assessment
        iv) operations and maintenance

========================================================================================

a. Key exchange

    - Symmetric algorithms depend upon shared secret keys.
    
    - Out-of-band key exchange
        - uses a different channel

    - out-of-band options
        - face-to-face meeting
        - physical mail
        - telephone call

    - out-of-band key exchange is difficult and time consuming.

    - solution to this problem is In-band key exchange

        - allows government access to keys
        
    - The clipper chip included technology that would allow government access to encrypted communications.

    - Privacy advocates and industry firms fought strongly against the Clipper chip.

    - Recovery agents
        - Allow internal access to lost keys
        

d. Key stretching

    - Takes a relatively insecure value, such as a password, and uses mathematical techniques
        to strengthen it, making it harder to crack.
    
    - Two techniques:-
        a) Salting
           - adds a value to the encryption key to make it more complex

        b) Hashing 
           - adds time to the verification process by requiring more math

    - Verifying one key is fast, but guessing millions of keys is slow.

    - PBKDF2
        - Password-Based Key Derivation Function v2
        - Uses salting and hashing to stretch a key
        - should be used at least 4000 times

===========================================================================================

11. Public key infrastructure

==========================================================================================

a. Trust models

    - Requirements for key exchange
        - The two parties must be confident that they are really communicating with each
            other and that neither one is an imposter.
        - The two parties must be confident that nobody is eavesdropping on the key exchange.
        
    - Asymmetric cryptography
        - Users don't need to chare their private keys
        - users can (and should) share their public keys freely.
        - Eavesdropping protection isn't needed during key exchange.
        - we still need to prevent imposters.

    - Trust models
        - Personal knowledge
        - Web of trust (WOT)
        - public key infrastructure (PKI)

    - Web of Trust
        - Relies on indirect relationships
        - participants digitally sign the public keys of people they know personally.
     
    - Web of Trust issue
        - Decentralized approach
        - high barrier to entry
        - requires technical knowledge

    - PKI builds upon the web of trust.

    - The public key infrastructure (PKI) depends upon highly trusted certificate authorities (CAs).

    - Anyone trying to use your digital certificate illegitimately won't have your private key.


c. Hash function

    - One-way functions that transform a variable length input into a unique, fixed-length output.

    - hash function characteristics
        - one-way functions can't be reversed
        - The output of a hash function will always be the same length, regardless of the 
            input size.
        - No two inputs to a hash function should produce the same output.
        
    - hash functions may fail
        - if they are reversible
        - if they are not collision resistant
    
    - Message Digest 5 (MD5)
        - Ron Rivest created MD5 in 1991
        - MD5 is the fifth in a series of hash functions
        - message digest is another term for hash
        - MD5 produces 128-bit hashes
        - MD5 is no longer secure

        - produces a 160-bit hash value
        - contains security flaws that render it insecure
     
    - SHA-2
        - consists of a family of six hash functions
        - produces output of 224, 256, 384, and 512 bits
        - uses a mathematically similar approach to SHA-1 and MD5
    
    - SHA-3
        - Designed to replace SHA-2
        - uses a completely different hash generation approach than SHA-2
        - produces hashes of user-selected fixed length
     
    - RIPEMD
        - created as an alternative to government-sponsored hash function
        - produces 128, 160, 256, and 320-bit hashes
        - contains flaws in the 128-bit version

    - HMAC
        - hash-based message authentication code
        - combines symmetric cryptography and hashing
        - provides authentication and integrity
        - create and verify message authentication code by using a secret key in conjuction
            with a hash function.

    - Hash functions are used with asymmetric cryptography for digital signatures and 
        digital certificates.
    

d. Digital signature

    - Digital signatures use asymmetric cryptography to achieve integrity, authentication,
        and non-repudiation.

    - Signed message recipients know
        - the owner of the public key is the person who signed the message
        - the message was not altered after being signed.
        - the recipient can prove these facts to the third party.

    - Digital signature depend upon
        - collision-resistant hash functions
        - asymmetric cryptography
        
    - Use your provate key to create digital signatures.

    - Digitally signing messages does not provide confidentiality.

e. Digital signature standard
