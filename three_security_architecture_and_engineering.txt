1. Secure Design
=================================================================

a. Security design principles

    - Security is a design element
        - bolt-on security rarely works.

    - Subject/Object Model
        - subject ------> object
        - User    ------> File
        - Process ------> Memory
     
    - Clearly designating subjects and objects improves design quality.

    - Failure modes
        - fail open
            - failed security controls are bypassed

        - fail secure
            - failed security controls block access

        - IDS (intruser detection system) failure
            
        - Isolation and segmentation


b. Security models

    - Security models provide a theoretical way of describing security controls.

    - Three levels of security models:-

    i) Multilevel security
        - Systems designed to operate at different security levels simultaneously while
            enforcing confidentiality and integrity constraints that restrict access
            between security levels.

     ii) Bell-LaPadula Model
        - Enforces confidentiality
        - simple security rule
            - No "read up"
        - *-property
            - No "write down" 
        
**** EXAM TIPS **********
    - The Bell-LaPadula model is rarely implemented outside of military applications.
*************************

    iii) Biba Model
        - Enforces integrity
        - Simple integrity property
            - No "read down"
        - *-Integrity property
            - No "write up"

***** EXAM TIPS ************
    - THE Bell-laPadula and Biba models are important for the exam but rarely used in the 
        real world.
*****************************


c. Security evaluation models

    - Cyber security programs first appeared within goverment agencies.
    - Trusted Computer System Evaluation Criteria (TCSEC)
    - Common Criteria
        - Unified evaluation processes
    - Certification and Accreditation
        - Certification
            - Determines that a system meets security criteria
        - Accrediation
            - Approves use of a system in a specific environment
        - Accrediation Decisions
            - Authorization to Operate (ATO)
            - Interim Authorization to Operate (IATO)
            - Interim Authorization to Test (IATT)
            - Denial of Authorization to Operate (DATO)

***** EXAM TIPS **********************
    - Certification and accreditation are different.
    - Accreditation and authorization are the same.
**************************************************** 


d. Seperation of duties

    - No individual should possess two permission that, in combination, allow them to
        perform a highly sensative action.
    
    - Two-person Control
        - requires the authorization of two separate individuals to carry out a sensitive
            actions; also known as dual control.


f. Selecting security controls

    - Security Controls
        - Procedures and mechanisms that an organization puts in place to manage security risks.
        - Defense in Depth
            - Multiple controls for one objective
            
    - We categorize controls by their purpose for mechanism of action.
    
        i) Preventive
            - Stop a security issue from occurring in the first place.
            
        ii) Detective
            - Identify that a potential security issue has taken place.
        
        iii) Corrective
            - Remediate security issue that have already occured.

        iv) Deterrent
            - Prevent an attacker from seeking to violate security policies.

        v) Physical
            - Impact the physical world.

        vi) Compensating

************************

    - Management controls
        - Imporve the security of the risk maangement process itself


g. Privacy by design
    
    - Privacy by design seeks to incorporate privacy practices into the design and implementation of systems.

    i) Proactive, not reactive; preventive, not remedial.
    ii) Privacy as the default setting
    iii) Privacy embedded into design
    iv) Full functionality: positive sum, not zero sum
    v) End-to-end security full lifecycle protection
    vi) Visibility and transparency: keep it open
    vii) Respect for user privacy: keep it user-centric
        

h. Secure defaults

    - Secure defaults ensure that a system runs in a secure mode if we don't configure it otherwise.

    - The zero-trust model applies least privilege to network access.

    - Zero-trust replaces network-based access control with strong user-focused authentication.

    - Trust, but verify.


========================================================================================

2. Virtualization and Cloud Computing

========================================================================================

a. What is the cloud?

            - one used in personal computers.


    - Virtualization Security
        - Virtual machine isolation is critical
        - Each server must have access to only its own memory and storage.
        - VM escape attacks attempt to break out of the guest environment.
        
    - Virtualization platform must be patched against security vulnerabilities.

    - VM Sprawl
        - Unused and unmaintained servers.

d. Codes and ciphers

**** EXAM TIPS ***************
    - Codes and ciphers are related concepts, but you should know the difference when you 
       take the exam.
****************************
   
     - Code
        - A system that substitutes one word or phrase for anther; intended to provide
            secrecy and/or efficiency.
        
     - Cipher
        - Asystem taht use mathematical algorithms to encrypt and decrypt messages.

    - Stream Ciphers
        - Operate on one character, or bit, of a message at a time.

    - Block ciphers
        - Operate on large segments of the message at the same time.

    - Substitution Ciphers
        - Change the characters in a message.

    - Substitution ciphers that shift each letter by an increment are called rotation ciphers. (ROT)

    - Transposition Ciphers
        - Rearrange the characters in a message.

    - Substitution and transposition are the building blocks of modern cryptography.


e. Cryptographic math

    - Math plays a central role in cryptography

    - Exclusive or (XOR)
        - True when exactly one of two input values is true.
   
    - Cryptography relies upon pseudorandom number generation because we lack a  source of 
        truly random numbers.

    - Confusion
        - Every bit of the ciphertext must depend upon more than one bit of the encryption key.
    
    - Diffusion
        - Changing a single bit of the plaintext should change about 50% of the ciphertext bits.

    - Obfuscation
        - Uses cryptography to hide source code from users.


e. Choosing encryption algorithms

*** EXAM TIPS *********
    - Don't try to build your own encryption algorithm unless you really know what you're doing.
***************************

    - Security through Obscurity
        - Security of an algorithm depends upon the secrecy of its approach.
    
    - Choosing your key length

    - Use tested encrytion modules and cryptographic service providers.



f. The perfect encryption algorithm

    - One-Time pad
        - It is an unbreakable encryption algorithm
        - Sender and receiver have identical pads
        - Key is at least as long as the message


g. The cryptographic lifecycle

    - The cryptographic lifecycle manages the use of encryption materials over time.

    - As cryptographic algorithms age, they often become insecure.

    - NSIT 5 phase cryptograhic lifecycle:-
        i) initiation
        ii) development and acquisition
        iii) implementation and assessment
        iv) operations and maintenance

        - Keying option 1
            - k1 != k2 != k3
        - Keying option 2
            - k1 = k3, k1 != k2, k2 != k3
        - keying option 3
            - k1 = k2 = k3

******* EXAM TIPS ***********
    - Double DES is no more secure than standard DES, due to the meet-in-the-middle attack.
*********************************    


c. AES, Blowfish, and Twofish

    - The Rijndael algorithm won a competition to become the Advanced Encryption Standard(AES).
    - AES uses substitution and transposition.
    - AES is symmtric encryption
    - Block cipher operation on 128-bit blocks
    - key length of 128, 192, or 256 bits.
    - Considered secure.

    - Blowfish
        - is a public domain algorithm.
        - designed as a DES replacement.
        - Uses a Feistel network.
        - combines substitution and transposition.

        - symmetric encryption algorithm
        - block cipher operating on 64-bit blocks
        - key length anywhere between 32 and 448 bits
        - not considerded secure.

    - Twofish
       - Designed as a DES replacement
       - placed into the public domain
       - use a Feistel network
       - combines substitution and transposition

        - symmetic encryption algorithm
        - block cipher operating on 128-bit blocks
        - key length of 128, 192, or 256 bits
        - considered secure


d. RC4

    - symmetric steam cipher
    
    - RC4 was a trade secret from its inverntion in 1987 until its public disclosure in 1994.
    
    - RC4 and Network Encryption
        - Wired equivalent privacy (WEP)
        - Wi-fi protected access (WPA)
        - Secure sockets layer (SSL)
        - Transport layer security (TLS)

    - RC4 uses a pseudorandom keystream.

    - RC4 is no longer considered secure.

    - symmetric encryption algorithm
    - stream cipher
    - variable length key between 40 bits and 2048 bits
    - not considered secure


e. Cipher modes

    - describes how an algorithm encrypts and decrypts data.

    - Electronic codebook (ECB) mode

    - Encrypting the same block with the same key in ECB mode results in identical ciphertextblocks.

    - Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) mode

    - Counter Mode (CTR)
        - Galois/Counter mode (GCM) adds authentication capability.

***** EXAM TIPS **********
    - Counter mode allows block ciphers to act more like stream ciphers.

9. Asymmetric Cryptography

=========================================================================================

a. RSA (Rivest, Shamir, Adelman)

**** EXAM TIPS*******
    - Users create RSA key pairs using two large prime numbers.
*******************************

    - Asymmetric encryption algorithm
    - Variable length key between 1024 and 4096 bits
    - Considered secure.


b. PGP and GnuPG

    - Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)
        - Phil Zimmerman's asymmetic algorithm
    
    - OpenPGP
        - open-source implementation of PGP

    - PGP function
        - Uses public and private keys
        - combines both symmetic and asymmetric cryptography

    - GnuPG
        -available for free

    - PGP relies upon other encryption algorithms.

    
c) Elliptic-curve and quantum cryptography

    - Elliptic curve and quantum cryptography use new approaches.

    - Asymmetric cryptography is based upon the difficulty of solving complex math problems.

    - Factoring prime numbers.

    - Finding a way to solve the prime factorization problem would break modern cryptography.
    - Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) **** (NOT IN EXAM)
        - uses the EC discrete log problem.
        
    - Quantum computing
        - Uses quantum mechanics principles
